                        One-way synonyms allow you to define alternative words for a search term, which are not synonyms to each others.<br>
                        Let’s take an example: when a user searches for “tablet”, you want him to be able to find iPads and Galaxy Note tablets alike, but you might not want Android tablets to show up when he searches for “iPad”.<br>
                        To do this, you’d define a one-way synonyms set between <code>tablet</code> (as input) and <code>ipad, galaxy note</code> (as synonyms). When the user types in “tablet”, records containing “iPad” and “Galaxy Note” will be returned. However records containing only “tablet” or “Galaxy Note” won’t be returned if he searches for “iPad”.<br>
